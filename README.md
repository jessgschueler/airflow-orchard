# Airflow Orchard
#### by Jess Schueler

### *An Apache Airflow example DAG*

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Apache Airflow
* Bash

## Description

Two Apache Airflow DAGs. The first uses Bash to create a text file, reads and prints that file with Python, creates three simultaneous tasks by making random selections from a list, and ensures everything ran by finishing with an empty operator.

The second uses decorators to establish our DAG and our Python operators. It utilizes Xcoms to pass return values along the DAG, using basic comparison operators to print whether there was enough rain to grow apples, or if we'll have 'better luck next year!'
